integrate news articles
classify news articles
then look at historical macro data
and see shock effects they have

add as a new NODE, like geopolitical event, policy event, etc. 
The data source is AI classification of news articles (type-casting). Then we check for similar ones in the past
Then we bring that data back into an AI for final judgement

use a news database, not normal. Also can use cheaper models perhaps
can use the cnn one. Hve headers, enough to roughly categorise. Then our actual one can have more detail, but for the classifying + training its sufficient. That covers geo/macro news
